- # Bonjour! ðŸ‘‹
- I am Adyaa Aradhana Panda, a 7th grade student.
- I live in Odisha, India.
- I'd like to enter Civil Service in future.
- I'm currently working on HTML & CSS.
- My hobbies include drawing caricatures/cartoons, dancing, reading stories, and writing poems.
- My favorite TV show is "Miraculous: Tales Of Ladybug & Cat Noir". When there are no MLB episodes to be watched, I like watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".
- My favorite animated film is Disney's "Encanto".
- At last, learn to dance in the rain, instead of waiting for the storm to pass. :)
